Lab 3: Airmouse

Checkpoint 1: Implement the battery monitoring circuit described above on a breadboard with the arduino and print the battery voltage (Vin) to the Serial monitor.

Checkpoint 2: Perfboard the entire Air Mouse.

Checkpoint 3: Using a struct, send button clicks and battery voltage level from the air mouse to the receiver. Print out the button clicks on the Serial Terminal on the receiver and display the battery voltage level using the LEDs.
